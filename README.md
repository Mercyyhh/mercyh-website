## Plans after migrating to react

other than a functioning portfolio website i have only one plan at the moment.

As you may or may not know a downside of hosting free on github that you cannot have a backend, that means i cannot make an editor in the website to create/edit posts and i would have to do it manually. 
But i dont want to do that, i want a clean editor that does it all for me. 

### To work around it: 
1. I will store all posts in a JSON file.
2. Write a python program to update the JSON with a clean CLI editor.
3. I can edit previous entries(posts) in the JSON as well. 
4. Import the JSON to the react app
5. And i should be able to set each object of the JSON and its contents to Blog posts or sth.

the changes to the JSON will be local so i will have to push it manually, but i think i can push it automatically in the python file... *i think...*
